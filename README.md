# SBSAnimoji

Fooling around with Apples private framework AvatarKit, the framework used in Messages.app for recording Animoji videos. If you are looking to create your own Animoji, take a look at [SBSCustomAnimoji](https://github.com/simonbs/SBSCustomAnimoji).

- Export videos to your photo library from the native share sheet.
- An example of how to use Apples AvatarKit.

### What you don't get

# Notice

This project relies heavily on Apples private API and you should therefore not try to submit this code to App Store.
